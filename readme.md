## String datatype with extended functionality for AngelScript

Written in AngelScript for ease of use with applications using AngelScript

Highly inspired by Ruby string

The functionality of AngelScripts native string is almost duplicated. Methods with capitalized names modify original string while uncapitalized create copies. 

Backwards compatible with AngelScript string. All methods can take standard strings as arguments.
